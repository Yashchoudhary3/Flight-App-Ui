# Test Coverage Report

## How to Generate

### Frontend
- Run tests with coverage:
  ```bash
  cd client
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```
- Coverage report will appear in `client/coverage/`

### Backend
- Run tests with coverage:
  ```bash
  cd server
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```
- Coverage report will appear in `server/coverage/`

## Note
- Ensure you have tests written for your components, routes, and business logic for meaningful coverage results.
